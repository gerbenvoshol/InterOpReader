# Illumina InterOp File Reader

This program is quickly hacked together to read various Illumina InterOp binary files, providing detailed output about sequencing metrics. These files include QMetrics, SummaryRunMetrics, TileMetrics, IndexMetrics, and CorrectedIntensityMetrics, each containing specific information about a sequencing run's performance. **This is not production ready!**

## Features

- Reads various Illumina InterOp files including:
  - `QMetricsOut.bin`
  - `SummaryRunMetricsOut.bin`
  - `TileMetricsOut.bin`
  - `IndexMetricsOut.bin`
  - `CorrectedIntMetricsOut.bin`
- Prints detailed information about sequencing metrics directly to the console.
- Supports multiple metric file types, each with a specific focus on different aspects of sequencing data quality and performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang) to compile the source code.
- Access to Illumina InterOp files generated by an Illumina sequencing instrument.

### Compilation

To compile the program, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
gcc -o interop_reader main.c
```
The program will automatically detect the type of InterOp file based on its name and print out the relevant sequencing metrics.

### Understanding the Output

The output varies depending on the InterOp file type provided. Generally, it includes key metrics such as:

- QMetrics: Quality scores across different bins.
- SummaryRunMetrics: Aggregate statistics about the run, such as cluster counts.
- TileMetrics: Performance metrics at the tile level, including cluster density.
- IndexMetrics: Indexing and sample identification metrics.
- CorrectedIntensityMetrics: Base calling intensity metrics after correction.

Each metric provides insights into different aspects of the sequencing run's performance, from overall run quality to detailed base calling statistics.
